# Stochastic Oscillator

This indicator compares the closing price of an asset with its price range over a period of time. It consists of two lines: %K which shows where the current price is relative to its range; %D which is a smoothed version of %K . A high %K value indicates overbought conditions (possible sell signal), while a low %K value indicates oversold conditions (possible buy signal). A crossover between %K and %D can also indicate trend changes.


Typically, a buy signal is generated when the stochastic oscillator line (%K) crosses above the oversold threshold (e.g., 20) from below. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when the stochastic oscillator line crosses below the overbought threshold (e.g., 80) from above.


This script calculates the stochastic oscillator K% and D% values for a given sequence of high, low and closing prices. 

The script performs the following functions:
1. It calculates the stochastic oscillator:
  - `K%` values, which is a moving average of the %K values.
  - `D%` values, which is a moving average of the %K values.
2. Then it decides whether to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** based on the calculated K% and D% values.


## Usage

This is a command-line script. The script's behavior can be customized with the following arguments:

- `-C`, `--closing_prices`: A comma-separated list of closing prices for the asset in current use. This argument is optional if and only if running a mock example (see `--use_mock` argument description below).
  
- `-H`, `--high_prices`: A comma-separated list of highest prices of the asset in consideration. This argument is optional if and only if you are running a mock example. 
  
- `-L`, `--low_prices`: A comma-separated list of lowest prices for the asset at study. This argument is optional if and only if running a mock example.
   
- `--interval`: Time interval for each candlestick. Default value is `"1d"`.
  
- `--k_period`: The number of time intervals (or periods) to be used in smoothing the K line calculation. Default value is `14`.
  
- `--d_period`: The number of time intervals (or periods) to be used in calculating the D line. Default value is `3`.
  
- `--threshold`: The buy/sell threshold percentage. Default value is `20`.
  
- `--use_mock`: If this argument is provided, the script will generate a mock example using random high, low, and closing prices.

The script can be run as follows:

```
python3 stoc_osc.py --closing_prices 100,200,300 --high_prices 150,250,350 --low_prices 50,100,200 --interval 1d --k_period 14 --d_period 3 --threshold 20
```

Alternatively, use the `--use_mock` flag to generate a dataset of random prices for testing.

```sh
python stoc_osc.py --use_mock
```


In this example, we are providing a list of `closing prices` with values [100, 200, 300], a list of `high prices` with values [150, 250, 350], and a list of `low prices` with values [50, 100, 200]. We're also setting the `interval` as 1 day, the `k_period` as 14, the `d_period` as 3, and the `threshold` as 20%.

## Output

The script outputs calculated K% and D% values, along with a buy/sell/hold signal â€“ "buy" if `K% > D%` and `K% > 1 - threshold`, "sell" if `K% < D%` and `K% < 1 - threshold`, and "hold" otherwise. It also reports how long it takes to calculate these values and outputs any eventual error information.

## Notes

The high, low and closing prices have to be listed in the same order they occurred. The earliest price goes first, and the latest price goes last.
