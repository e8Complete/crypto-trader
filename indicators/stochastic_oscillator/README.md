# Stochastic Oscillator

This indicator compares the closing price of an asset with its price range over a period of time. It consists of two lines: %K which shows where the current price is relative to its range; %D which is a smoothed version of %K . A high %K value indicates overbought conditions (possible sell signal), while a low %K value indicates oversold conditions (possible buy signal). A crossover between %K and %D can also indicate trend changes.


Typically, a buy signal is generated when the stochastic oscillator line (%K) crosses above the oversold threshold (e.g., 20) from below. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when the stochastic oscillator line crosses below the overbought threshold (e.g., 80) from above.
