The calculate_fib_levels function in the Fibonacci retracements module returns three Fibonacci retracement levels, which are the 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels. These levels are commonly used in technical analysis to identify potential levels of support and resistance in the market.

In terms of determining a buy, sell, or hold signal based on these levels, it would depend on the specific trading strategy being employed.

For example, a trader who is using Fibonacci retracements as part of a swing trading strategy may look for a bullish signal to buy when the price retraces to the 38.2% or 50% retracement level and then resumes its upward trend. Conversely, they may look for a bearish signal to sell when the price retraces to the 61.8% level and then continues to move downwards.

However, it is important to note that Fibonacci retracements are just one tool in a trader's toolbox and should be used in conjunction with other indicators and analysis to make informed trading decisions.
